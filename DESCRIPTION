Description: The numerical treatment of optimal switching problems in a finite time setting when the state evolves as a controlled Markov chain consisting of a uncontrolled continuous component following linear dynamics and a controlled Markov chain taking values in a finite set. The reward functions are assumed to be convex and Lipschitz continuous in the continuous state. The action set is finite.
